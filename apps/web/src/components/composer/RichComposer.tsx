/**
 * Keyboard ride for the composer sheet.
 *
 * Why a dedicated writer instead of the global `--kb-inset`: the sheet is a
 * fixed overlay with its own scroller and a locked page behind it, so the
 * only thing it needs is `bottom` == the live keyboard height.
 *
 * Two things used to make the open glide visibly jump on iOS, both fixed here:
 *
 * 1. Stepwise events. visualViewport resize events are choppy (a handful of
 *    steps for the whole slide) while `vv.height` itself is LIVE. Every real
 *    event therefore arms a short per-frame follow loop that re-reads the
 *    live geometry each frame — the sheet glides at 60fps instead of
 *    stepping. Upward follow moves are gated exactly like events (see below):
 *    a fresh fall with no user intent behind it is the mid-hide freeze, and
 *    tracking its stale "open" geometry would snap the bar back up.
 * 2. Safari toolbar drift. iOS hides its bottom toolbar as the keyboard rises,
 *    growing `window.innerHeight` mid-animation — measuring against the live
 *    value injects that growth as a one-frame jump. The inset is measured
 *    against a baseline frozen while the keyboard is closed (refreshed on
 *    every settled closed event), so it stays a pure function of the visual
 *    viewport.
 *
 * Close is the one asymmetric case: iOS freezes visualViewport while the
 * keyboard slides away, so the last live value would stick until the
 * keyboard is gone and then teleport. The descent therefore starts on blur
 * (100ms delay, so quick refocuses and dialog inputs never start it) and
 * eases down through the same follower. Every viewport event meanwhile is
 * arbitrated by focus (see resolveSheetBottomAction): a stale WebKit "open"
 * transient with focus elsewhere is ignored instead of snapping the bar back
 * up mid-glide.
 * A fast poll while an editable owns focus covers the hide-button case —
 * the keyboard gone, focus retained, viewport frozen: no focusout ever
 * fires, so without the poll the bar floats until the next tick.
 *
 * Open has its own mirror race: the poll (or the first sparse event) can read
 * the geometry BEFORE the keyboard commits — inset still ~0, focus already in
 * the sheet — and that "closed" verdict starts the descent while the keyboard
 * is rising. The next event then snaps the bar back up: the visible DOWN-UP
 * jump. An opening grace covers it: for a short window after genuine user
 * intent (focus/tap in the sheet) a "closed" read with focus held is treated
 * as the animation's leading edge and tracked, never descended. The grace
 * only applies while the keyboard was never seen open since the intent
 * (`seenOpen`), so a genuine hide (hide button, gesture) still glides at once.
 *
 * Why easing instead of direct writes: visualViewport commits arrive in 2–3
 * coarse steps, and writing them straight through IS the teleport ("no
 * animation"). The follower eases the display toward each gated target every
 * frame (fast up so it stays glued to the rising keys, deliberately lazier
 * down so it settles under the departing keyboard instead of dropping
 * through it), so even sparse commits read as one continuous glide.
