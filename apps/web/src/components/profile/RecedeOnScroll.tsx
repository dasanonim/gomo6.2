/**
 * Pulls a block "into" the top edge as the page scrolls: the block scales down,
 * rises and loses contrast just before it leaves the viewport, then the next
 * block does the same. Every instance measures its own document box, so stacked
 * blocks (header → stats → bio → pins) are drawn in one after another with no
 * shared timeline and no per-frame React state.
 *
 * Coming back up is NOT the same curve in reverse. Once a block has been drawn
 * in past the visible edge it latches: the page keeps scrolling, the block
 * stays compressed, and it takes a deliberate upward pull (more distance the
 * slower you scroll) to free it. The release runs on the under-damped `eject`
 * spring, so it overshoots ~6–8% and settles instead of sliding back. A scroll
 * down at any point cancels the pull or the release and re-latches immediately,
 * so the gesture is always interruptible and native scrolling is never blocked.
 *
 * The measuring wrapper never receives the transform — only the inner element
 * does — so `getBoundingClientRect` on the wrapper keeps returning the layout
 * box even while the content is scaled.
