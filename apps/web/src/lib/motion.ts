/**
 * Motion language — spring presets and spatial helpers.
 *
 * The app animates with SPRINGS, not with duration/ease curves: a spring has
 * velocity, so an interrupted animation continues from where it is instead of
 * restarting, and the tail decelerates like a physical object. `duration` is
 * only used for opacity (a fade has no physics) and as the reduced-motion
 * fallback.
 *
 * Presets are named by intent, not by number, so every surface that means the
 * same thing moves the same way:
 *
 *   snappy   — direct manipulation feedback (press, hover, toggle). Instant.
 *   standard — the default for entering/exiting content.
 *   soft     — large surfaces: panels, containers, page-level reflow.
 *   sheet    — sheets/dialogs that come from an edge and settle.
 *   pop      — small punctuation: a badge landing, an icon bouncing.
 *
 * Reduced motion is honoured per-component via `useSpring(reduce)`; when it is
 * on, every preset collapses to an instant transition and spatial offsets are
 * dropped.
 *
 * Signed-off taste and locked parameters live in docs/wiki/MOTION_TASTE.md —
 * read it before adding or retuning a preset.
